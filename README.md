## Rock Paper Scissors
One of the first projects I've ever built was this.

this install and serve locally make sure to have node and npm installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmanuelIsaak/RockPaperScissor
```

After that use this command to run it:
```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```

If for some reason the website ins't running use some of this commands:

```bash
npm audit fix
npx vite
```

Enjoy!
